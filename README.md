<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an **UNOFFICIAL** Home Assistant integration for control of Uplift Desk standing desks over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). For this library to work, you must have the [Uplift Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.upliftdesk.com/bluetooth-adapter-for-uplift-desk/?15775=12278) installed in a compatible desk. See their website for a better understanding of desk compatibility. 

This integration relies on the uplift-ble Python package, which can be found on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/uplift-ble/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/librick/uplift-ble). Please head over there if you have issues related to that library or would like to contribute to functionality :)

> Note: When using this project, no other device can be connected to the desk or it will be undiscoverable. This means that the Uplift Desk app needs to be either disconnected or closed for this application to work.

> Normally, an advanced keypad with programmable buttons is required to use this integration (to set the presets the integration exposes). However, for users without an advanced keypad, the desk can still be programmed with preset values using the cli provided by the [uplift-ble](https://github.com/librick/uplift-ble) to set the preset values. 

The integration currently provides 5 entities:
1. A sensor for the current height of the desk. This will update automatically as your desk is moving, though it is not instantaneous and should not be relied on for safety.
2. A button to move the desk to its configured preset 1.
3. A button to move the desk to its configured preset 2.
4. A disabled-by-default button to move supported desks to configured preset 3.
5. A disabled-by-default button to move supported desks to configured preset 4.

Preset 3 and 4 buttons are currently limited to the verified `0x00FF` and
`0xFE60` desk profiles.
